      "Web3 refers to the vision of a decentralized internet built on blockchain technology. " +
      "Unlike Web2 (the current internet), Web3 aims to reduce reliance on centralized platforms " +
      "by empowering users with ownership of their data and digital assets through blockchain " +

    topic: "What is a Wallet",
    content: 
      "A Web3 wallet is a digital tool that allows users to store, manage, and interact with " +
      "cryptocurrencies and blockchain-based assets. Unlike traditional wallets, Web3 wallets " +
      "store private keys that prove ownership of digital assets on the blockchain. Popular " +
      "wallets include MetaMask, Trust Wallet, and Coinbase Wallet. Wallets can be custodial " +
      "(managed by a third party) or non-custodial (where you control your private keys).",

    topic: "Connecting Wallet",
    content: 
      "To connect your wallet to a dApp (decentralized application), follow these steps: " +
      "1. Install a Web3 wallet like MetaMask as a browser extension or mobile app. " +
      "2. Set up your wallet by creating a new account or importing an existing one. " +
      "3. Visit the dApp website and find a 'Connect Wallet' button. " +
      "4. Click this button and select your wallet from the options. " +
      "5. Approve the connection request in your wallet. " +
      "Always verify you're on the correct website before connecting to avoid phishing attacks.",

    topic: "Gas Fees",
    content: 
      "Gas fees are payments made by users to compensate for the computing energy required to " +
      "process and validate transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. They are paid in Ether (ETH) " +
      "and consist of a base fee (burned) and a priority fee (tip to validators). Gas fees vary " +
      "based on network congestionâ€”when many people use the network simultaneously, fees increase. " +
      "To reduce gas costs, consider transacting during periods of low network activity or using " +
      "Layer 2 scaling solutions like Optimism or Arbitrum.",

  {
    topic: "Smart Contracts",
    content: 
      "Smart contracts are self-executing programs stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined " +
      "conditions are met. They automate agreements so that all participants can be immediately certain " +
      "of the outcome, without any intermediary's involvement. Smart contracts are used for creating " +
      "tokens, developing decentralized applications (dApps), establishing governance systems, and " +
      "automating financial transactions. They're primarily written in languages like Solidity (Ethereum) " +
      "or Rust (Solana) and are immutable once deployed to the blockchain.",

      "Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are unique digital assets that represent ownership of specific items " +
      "on the blockchain. Unlike cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, each NFT has distinct " +
      "properties that make it non-interchangeable. NFTs are commonly used for digital art, collectibles, " +
      "gaming items, and access passes. They provide proof of authenticity and ownership through blockchain " +
      "technology. To buy or sell NFTs, you typically need a wallet compatible with the blockchain they're " +

      "Decentralized Finance (DeFi) refers to financial services built on blockchain technology that " +
      "operate without centralized intermediaries like banks. DeFi applications enable users to lend, " +
      "borrow, trade, earn interest, and moreâ€”all through smart contracts. Popular DeFi activities " +
      "include providing liquidity to decentralized exchanges (DEXs), yield farming, staking, and " +
      "taking out collateralized loans. Major DeFi platforms include Uniswap, Aave, Compound, and " +
      "MakerDAO. While DeFi offers financial inclusion and innovation, it carries risks including " +

      "Common Web3 security concerns include: " +
      "1. Phishing attacks - Fake websites or communications that trick users into sharing wallet keys or approving malicious transactions. " +
      "2. Smart contract vulnerabilities - Code flaws that can be exploited to drain funds. " +
      "3. Rug pulls - When developers abandon a project and take investor funds. " +
      "4. Seed phrase theft - When your wallet recovery phrase is compromised. " +
      "5. Approval exploits - When users give unlimited token approvals to potentially malicious contracts. " +
      "Always verify website URLs, use hardware wallets for large holdings, research projects thoroughly, " +

      "involves token holders voting on proposals that affect the protocol's development and operations. " +
      "Governance mechanisms vary across projects but often include on-chain voting where votes are " +
      "weighted by token holdings. Governance tokens grant holders voting rights, and Decentralized " +
      "Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are organizations governed by smart contracts and community " +

      "that improve transaction speed and reduce costs. They process transactions off the main chain " +
      "while inheriting the security of the underlying blockchain. Major types include: " +
      "1. Rollups (like Optimism and Arbitrum) that execute transactions off-chain but post data to Ethereum. " +
      "2. State channels that enable off-chain transactions between participants. " +
      "3. Sidechains that run parallel to the main blockchain with their own consensus mechanisms. " +
